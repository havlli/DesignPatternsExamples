# Composite Pattern
The Composite pattern is a design pattern that allows you to treat a group of objects in the same way as a single object. It is a structural pattern that lets you create hierarchical structures of objects and then work with those structures as if they were individual objects.

In the Composite pattern, there are two types of objects: leaf nodes and composite nodes. Leaf nodes represent the individual objects in the hierarchy, while composite nodes represent collections of objects, including other composite nodes and leaf nodes.

The main idea behind the Composite pattern is to allow clients to treat individual objects and collections of objects uniformly. This simplifies the client code and makes it more generic, as the client doesn't need to know whether it is working with a single object or a collection of objects.

In Java, the Composite pattern can be implemented using the following steps:

1.  Define an interface or abstract class that represents the component.
2.  Define one or more leaf classes that implement the component interface.
3.  Define an abstract composite class that also implements the component interface.
4.  Define one or more composite classes that extend the abstract composite class and add functionality.
5.  Use the composite objects to create a hierarchical structure of objects.

Here's an example that demonstrates how the Composite pattern can be used to create a hierarchical structure of employees in a company:
```java
// Step 1: Define the component interface
interface Employee {
    void print();
}

// Step 2: Define the leaf classes
class Developer implements Employee {
    private String name;

    public Developer(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Developer: " + name);
    }
}

class Manager implements Employee {
    private String name;

    public Manager(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Manager: " + name);
    }
}

// Step 3: Define the abstract composite class
abstract class EmployeeGroup implements Employee {
    private List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employees.add(employee);
    }

    public void removeEmployee(Employee employee) {
        employees.remove(employee);
    }

    public void print() {
        for (Employee employee : employees) {
            employee.print();
        }
    }
}

// Step 4: Define the composite classes
class DevelopmentTeam extends EmployeeGroup {
    public DevelopmentTeam() {
        addEmployee(new Developer("John"));
        addEmployee(new Developer("Jane"));
    }
}

class ManagementTeam extends EmployeeGroup {
    public ManagementTeam() {
        addEmployee(new Manager("Bob"));
        addEmployee(new Manager("Alice"));
    }
}

// Step 5: Use the composite objects to create a hierarchical structure of objects
public class CompositePatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Employee developmentTeam = new DevelopmentTeam();
        Employee managementTeam = new ManagementTeam();

        EmployeeGroup allEmployees = new EmployeeGroup() {
            {
                addEmployee(developmentTeam);
                addEmployee(managementTeam);
                addEmployee(new Developer("Mike"));
                addEmployee(new Manager("Dave"));
            }
        };

        allEmployees.print();
    }
}
```
In this example, we start by defining the `Employee` interface, which has a single method `print()`. Then, we define two leaf classes `Developer` and `Manager` that implement this interface.

Next, we define the abstract `EmployeeGroup` class that also implements the `Employee` interface and has a list of `Employee` objects as a member variable. This class provides common functionality for the composite classes that extend it, including adding and removing employees and printing the entire group of employees.

Finally, we define two composite classes `DevelopmentTeam` and `ManagementTeam`
