# Template Method Pattern
The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for certain steps of the algorithm.

The Template Method Pattern is particularly useful in situations where you have a common algorithm that needs to be implemented in different ways depending on the context or application. By defining the algorithm in a base class and allowing subclasses to override specific steps, you can create a flexible and reusable solution that can be adapted to different situations.

The pattern consists of two key components: a base class that defines the basic structure of the algorithm, and one or more subclasses that provide concrete implementations for certain steps of the algorithm.

The base class contains a template method that defines the basic steps of the algorithm. This template method may call other abstract or concrete methods within the base class to perform specific tasks, but the key point is that the overall structure of the algorithm is fixed and cannot be changed by subclasses.

The subclasses provide their own implementations for certain steps of the algorithm by overriding the abstract or virtual methods defined in the base class. This allows the subclasses to customize the behavior of the algorithm while still adhering to the overall structure defined in the base class.

One of the main advantages of the Template Method Pattern is that it promotes code reuse and reduces duplication. By defining the basic structure of an algorithm in a single place, you can avoid having to write similar code in multiple places throughout your application. This not only reduces the amount of code you need to write, but also makes your application easier to maintain and update.

In addition to promoting code reuse, the Template Method Pattern can also make your code more flexible and extensible. By allowing subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm, you can adapt the behavior of the algorithm to different contexts or requirements without having to modify the underlying code.

Overall, the Template Method Pattern is a powerful design pattern that can help you create more flexible, reusable, and maintainable code.

### Simple Example
Suppose you are building a simple application that allows users to register and login. You could create a base class called `UserAuthenticator` that defines a template for authenticating a user. The base class might have the following template method:
```java
public abstract class UserAuthenticator {

  public final boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {

    if (!validateUsername(username)) {
      return false;
    }

    if (!validatePassword(password)) {
      return false;
    }

    return doAuthenticate(username, password);
  }

  protected abstract boolean doAuthenticate(String username, String password);

  private boolean validateUsername(String username) {
    // Implement username validation
  }

  private boolean validatePassword(String password) {
    // Implement password validation
  }
}
```
In this example, the `authenticate` method is the template method that defines the basic algorithm for authenticating a user. The `validateUsername` and `validatePassword` methods are helper methods that can be used to validate the input parameters. The `doAuthenticate` method is the abstract method that subclasses must implement to perform the actual authentication.

Now, let's say you want to create two types of authenticators: one that authenticates users against a database and another that authenticates users against a web service. You can create two subclasses of `UserAuthenticator` that override the `doAuthenticate` method to implement the specific authentication logic:
```java
public class DatabaseUserAuthenticator extends UserAuthenticator {

  protected boolean doAuthenticate(String username, String password) {
    // Implement database authentication logic
  }
}
```
```java
public class WebServiceUserAuthenticator extends UserAuthenticator {

  protected boolean doAuthenticate(String username, String password) {
    // Implement web service authentication logic
  }
}
```
In this example, both subclasses inherit the `authenticate` method from the base class and only need to implement the `doAuthenticate` method to provide their own specific authentication logic.

When a user tries to log in, the application can create an instance of the appropriate authenticator subclass based on the authentication method selected by the user and then call the `authenticate` method. The `authenticate` method will then execute the steps defined in the base class (`UserAuthenticator`) and call the `doAuthenticate` method implemented in the specific subclass to perform the authentication.
