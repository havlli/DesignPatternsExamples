The singleton with initialization holder pattern is a variant of the lazy singleton pattern, which provides thread-safe lazy initialization of the singleton instance without using synchronization. This pattern takes advantage of the fact that inner classes in Java are not loaded until they are actually referenced, and uses an inner class to hold the singleton instance until it is needed.

Suppose you are building a cache manager for a web application. You want to ensure that there is only one instance of the cache manager throughout the entire application, to prevent issues with resource contention and consistency. Additionally, you want the cache manager to be lazily initialized to conserve resources and improve startup time.

To accomplish this, you could implement the cache manager as a singleton with initialization holder. The `getInstance()` method of the singleton class would return the single instance of the cache manager, which would be initialized when the class is first referenced.
``` java
public class CacheManager {
    private CacheManager() {
        // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
    }
    
    private static class SingletonHolder {
        private static final CacheManager INSTANCE = new CacheManager();
    }
    
    public static CacheManager getInstance() {
        return SingletonHolder.INSTANCE;
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties of the singleton class
}
```
Now, any part of the web application that needs to access the cache manager can simply call the `getInstance()` method to obtain the cache manager instance, without having to worry about initializing or managing the cache manager object themselves. The cache manager will be created only when it is first requested, and subsequently reused for all future requests.

This approach provides a flexible and resource-efficient way to manage caching throughout the web application, while also ensuring that there is only one instance of the cache manager in the entire application.
