Suppose you are building a logging utility for a large distributed system. You want to ensure that there is only one instance of the logging utility throughout the entire system, to prevent issues with resource contention and consistency. However, you also want to conserve resources by only creating the logging utility when it is actually needed, rather than immediately upon application startup.

To accomplish this, you could implement the logging utility as a lazy singleton. The `getInstance()` method of the singleton class would lazily initialize the single instance of the logging utility when it is first requested, and return that instance for subsequent requests.
``` java
public class LoggingUtility {
    private static LoggingUtility instance;
    
    private LoggingUtility() {
        // Private constructor to prevent external instantiation
    }
    
    public static synchronized LoggingUtility getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LoggingUtility();
        }
        return instance;
    }
    
    // Other methods and properties of the singleton class
}
```
Now, any component in the distributed system that needs to log events or messages can simply call the `getInstance()` method to obtain the logging utility instance, without having to worry about initializing or managing the logging utility object themselves. The logging utility will be created only when it is first requested, and subsequently reused for all future requests.

This approach provides a flexible and resource-efficient way to manage logging throughout the distributed system, while also ensuring that there is only one instance of the logging utility in the entire system.
